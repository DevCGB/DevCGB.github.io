## Welcoming the first blog on this site

Hello, and welcome to this blog page. I think, for your sake, it's important that I set some expectations early. I am not the best programmer there is. I bet you're excited to read the rest of this blog now, aren't you. Anyway, enough jokes, you're probably wondering the purpose of this whole site. Well, if the following post is written well, you'll hopefully be able to understand the sort of things I'll be sharing.

### Project sharing

The main reason I wanted to create this blog was to share the projects I am currently working on. Personally, I always find it interesting to see what people are working on, along with any tips or code they're willing to share, so I aim to do so on this page. As I said earlier, I am by no means an amazing programmer, so the code shared on this site may be inefficient, wrong, slow, or all the above. If that is the case, don't forget to point and laugh at me. Again, jokes aside, if you notice a function, class, or (at this point) a variable that could be rewritten in a better way, feel free to contact me as I am always up for feedback. Anyway, back to the point. I want to start many projects this year (I'm sure this is a statement that has come from many developers mouths before), and I want to share as much as I can. As much of a trash developer I claim to be, I'd love for someone to gain something from reading these articles. Whether that's finding new packages to use, new ways of writing code (unlikely), or even just for a bit of "entertainment", I'd consider that a successful mission.

When I share code, I will display it in code blocks like this:

```python
x = 10

for i in range(x):
    print('Please work!')

```

Along with code snippets, I aim to provide a detailed explanation of what the program does; explanations will range in detail based on the complexity of the code being shown. Here I’ll  try to justify my abhorrent code choices and why I’ve chosen to do things in a specific way.

### Tutorials

I know I’ve spent the last few minutes ruining any form of credibility you initially had for my skills as a programmer, but I do hope to make some articles that provide information to people. As I go through my projects, I’ll inevitably come face to face with problems to which I’ll struggle to find solutions to. In these cases, I aim to create detailed tutorials that cover these problems for those who may  find themselves in a similar situation.

Right, let’s address the elephant in the room. I know you’re all sitting there thinking “I’d just use AI”, and to be honest, I don’t blame you. AI is such a powerful tool, and I’m not going to pretend to sit on my high horse and say I don’t use it, because I do. However, I’ve come to realise how much I really do use AI, and it’s with this reflection that I’ve found motivation to find solutions to problems myself, rather than just relying on some data centre in London to do the work for me. Now, I know I am not alone in this mentality, which is the very reason I want to create these tutorials. For me personally, I find articles such an easy and rewarding way to quickly learn. This is because of their small and detailed nature. We’re all familiar with websites like W3 Schools or freecodecamp; my goal is to provide useful information like these. Just like the projects section, if I produce a tutorial that doesn’t make sense, or seems too complicated, please feel free to contact me.

### Anything else

This site is a project itself; meaning that it will constantly be changing. There is no road map yet, but I do welcome any changes that people may want. In addition to this, there may be posts that I have not listed in this article, for example, a post that explains my thoughts with a current technology, or why I think AI may take over the world (just to clarify, that is a joke). Overall, I’m just trying to say that just because I haven’t explicitly stated it here, doesn’t mean that I’m not willing to start something new or implement a new idea.

### Will I use AI for these posts?

To be honest, this was a quick addition to the end of this post, but I feel that it is important to say. All written work that you read on this site will be done purely by hand and I never have intentions to change that. In terms of code, I aim to mainly share code that was written by me, however, there may be instances where AI has been used. To ensure transparency, I will clearly label code snippets that include AI written code. I believe it’s right that I clearly label uses of AI, as I don’t want to mislead anyone into thinking it was written by me.
