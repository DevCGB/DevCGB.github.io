description: "A space for writing about software, systems, and projects as I work through them. Some posts are clear explanations, some are experiments, and some are just notes that turned out to be useful. Written from practical experience, learned mostly the hard way, and shared without pretending to have everything figured out." # This will show up in places like twitter, linkedin, etc, if you share your sites url as a post.
